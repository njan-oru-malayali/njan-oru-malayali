Some villages are way too beautiful in Germany. I live in a place called Birkenfeld, which is in the state Baden Wuttemberg. This place is near to the Black Forest, which is a great tourist spot. The quality of life is too good, I have done a overview video of this beautiful German village, you can watch it and understand how things are here.
