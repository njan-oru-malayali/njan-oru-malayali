This is one of the best tourist attraction in London, if you go to London, never forget to visit this place. There is an option of doing a cruise ride before you do the Londo Eye ride, it is a must do and you can get the ticket for 5 pounds. You will be able to see the views of amazing london bridges and some other traditional famous architecture, like House of Parliament, London. I hope you will like this video.
