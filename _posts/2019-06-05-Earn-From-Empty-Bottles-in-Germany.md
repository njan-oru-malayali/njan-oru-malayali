In this Video, we will talk about how we can earn from emppty bottles in Germany. You can easily give all of your bottles in any nearby Supermarkets. The system is very easy and efficient, all you have to do is to take your bottles there and put in in a machine, which usually be placed at the entrance of the supermarkets. You will get a bill from the machine once you have finished putting the bottles, you can buy things from the supermarkets with that bill, you will have to pay extra only if your supermarket bill crosses the bill value of your bottles. 

#### How?

I have uploaded a video on our YouTube Channel, you can watch the same and understand.
